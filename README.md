# Convergent evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron subvariants leading to the emergence of BQ.1.1 variant

## Summary
In late 2022, although the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron subvariants have highly diversified, some lineages have convergently acquired amino acid substitutions at five critical residues in the spike protein. Here, we illuminated the evolutionary rules underlying the convergent evolution of Omicron subvariants and the properties of one of the latest lineages of concern, BQ.1.1.
